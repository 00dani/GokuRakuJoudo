[commits in 0.1.9]: https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo/compare/v0.1.8...v0.1.9

** 0.1.8 - 2018-09-24
*** Added
- old ~:layers~ predefinition

#+begin_src clojure
;; before this feature
;; can only define "old" layers like this
{:main [{:des "w layer"
         :rules [[:w ["wlayer" 1] nil {:alone :w :afterup ["wlayer" 0]}]
                 [:e "open -a Emacs.app" :wlayer]
                 [:s "open -a Safari.app" :wlayer]]}]}

;; now we can do it with predefined layer
{:layers {:wlayer {:key :w}}
  :main [{:des "w layer"
          :rules [[:e "open -a Emacs.app" :wlayer]
                  [:s "open -a Safari.app" :wlayer]]}]}
#+end_src

- group rules by conditions

#+begin_src clojure
;; before this feature
;; we have to declare conditions in each rule, like this
{:layers {:wlayer {:key :w}
          :xlayer {:key :x}}
 :main [{:des "example layer"
         :rules [[:e "open -a Emacs.app" :wlayer]
                 [:s "open -a Safari.app" :wlayer]
                 [:i "open -a iTunes.app" :xlayer]]}]}

;; now we can group rules with conditions
{:applications {:chromes ["^com\\.google\\.Chrome$"
                          "^org\\.chromium\\.Chromium$"
                          "^com\\.google\\.Chrome\\.canary$"]}
 :layers {:wlayer {:key :w}
          :xlayer {:key :x}}
 :main [{:des "example layer"
         :rules [:wlayer
                 [:e "open -a Emacs.app"]
                 [:s "open -a Safari.app"]
                 :xlayer
                 [:i "open -a iTunes.app"]

                 ;; support multiple conditions
                 ;; use vector start with :condi for multiple conditions
                 [:condi :xlayer :chromes]
                 [:i "open -a iTunes.app"]

                 ;; you can still spercify conditions as the third element of the rule vector
                 ;; it will be combined with the group condition
                 ;; below rule is same as above one
                 :xlayer
                 [:i "open -a iTunes.app" :chromes]]}]}
#+end_src
